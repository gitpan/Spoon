NAME
    Spoon - A Spiffy Application Building Framework

SYNOPSIS
        Out of the Cutlery Drawer
        And onto the Dinner Table

DESCRIPTION
    Spoon is an Application Framework that is designed primarily for
    building Social Software web applications. The Kwiki wiki software is
    built on top of Spoon.

    Spoon::Base is the primary base class for all the Spoon::* modules.
    Spoon.pm inherits from Spiffy.pm.

    Spoon is not an application in and of itself. (As compared to Kwiki) You
    need to build your own applications from it.

SEE ALSO
    Kwiki, Spork, Spiffy, IO::All

DEDICATION
    This project is dedicated to the memory of Iain "Spoon" Truskett.

CREDIT
    Dave Rolsky and Chris Dent have made major contributions to this code
    base. Of particular note, Dave removed the memory cycles from the hub
    architecture, allowing safe use with mod_perl.

    (Dave, Chris and myself currently work at Socialtext, where this
    framework is heavily used.)
